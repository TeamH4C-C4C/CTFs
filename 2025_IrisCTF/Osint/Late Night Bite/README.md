Some nights, I enjoy walking out to this modern local izakaya restaurant. They close pretty late, which makes it perfect for a late night snack. What makes this place unique is their dedication to brewing their own teas and constantly experimenting with new dishes on the menu. I like to order their mocktail Shiso Dry as my drink. As for meal spicy tuna onigiri with a bowl of miso soup is enough for me.

I just want to show my appreciation and admiration for this place. But you guys will never find it! I regularly come here during the weekends.
